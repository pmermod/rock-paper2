# Rock Paper Scissors

This is my final project for the JavaScript Fundamentals course.

Rock Paper Scissors is a web based, single player game where the player tries to beat the computer by selecting the more powerful weapon.

In the game

- rock beats scissors
- scissors beats paper
- paper beats rock

### How to Play

Choose a weapon by selecting its button and see the outcome on the following screen. 

That's the whole game. Grok it's hidden depths if you dare.
Naturally you'll want to repeat the enormity of this experience so a Play Again button is provided for your relief.
